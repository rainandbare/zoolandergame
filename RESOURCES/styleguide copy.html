<h2>"It's A Walk Off."</h2>


<h3>If you are Derek</h3> 
<p>Han-sell-out is about to have his Han-sell-ass...handed to him on a platter with french-fried potatoes.</p>
<p>Age before beauty, goat cheese.</p> 
<p>Good luck, Derek! Kick Hansel's ass!</p>
<p>You want to see the real world of male modeling?</p>
<p>Now, this'll be a straight walk-off, old school rules.</p>
<p>"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking. Maybe you could do that for a career"</p>
<p>You may have butterflies in your basket but I think you're doing okay.</p>

<p>You want to see the real world of male modeling?</p>
<p>Now, this'll be a straight walk-off, old school rules.</p>
<p>"Wow, you're ridiculously good-looking. Maybe you could do that for a career"</p>

<p>What is this a center for ants?!!</p>
<!-- <p>He's almost too good-looking. That would be my main deterrent in considering a relationship.</p> -->
<h3>Fuctional:</h3> 
<p>Hey, I got a wacky idea. What say we settle this on the runway... </p> 
<!-- I'm "shvitzing" like a "shmedrik" with all these lights.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Boo-lander. Han-solo.</p> -->
<!-- <p>You want to see the real world of male modeling?</p>

<p>ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCCINO!!!</p>
<!-- <p>Okay, boys, let's go to work.</p> -->
<h3>Encouragement:</h3>
<p>Words can only hurt you if you try to read them. Don't play their game!</p>
<!-- That Hansel â€“ He's so hot right now! -->
<!-- h3>Winning:</h3>

<p>And all he had to do was turn left. I am not an ambiturner.</p>


<h3>Losing:</h3>

<p>I'm a hot little potato right now!</p> -->
